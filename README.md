# IceWall
AI-powered cybersecurity project. Predicts and counters network threats with advanced algorithms and post-processing codes. A thesis submitted for the degree of Engineering informatics.

###### This file gives information on how to use the implementation files of "IceWall". The first steps are based on the thesis "Anomaly Detection in Networks Using Machine Learning".

We used python 3.11.9 and the following libraries to create all the files of IceWall.

| Library | Task |
| ------ | ------ |
|[ Sklearn ](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)| Machine Learning Library|
| [ Numpy ](http://www.numpy.org/) |Mathematical Operations|
| [ Pandas  ](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html)|  Data Analysis Tools |
| [ Matplotlib ](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) |Graphics and Visuality|

We have followed steps to develop the tool:

1- Pre-processing
2- Analysis of data
3- Files for each attack
4- Feature Selection
5- General training
6- Training results analysis
7- Predictive model training
8- Post-processing
